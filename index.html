                    <li>Chameleons' eyesight has developed both to help them catch prey and, as we've seen, to help them escape predators. </li>
                    <li>They can focus their eyes relatively well, meaning they can judge distances and spot prey between 5 and 10 metres. </li>
                    <li>Chameleons also can see ultraviolet light, which isn't visible to humans.</li>

                    <li>Camels have three sets of eyelids and two rows of eyelashes to keep sand out of their eyes. </li>
                    <li>Camels have thick lips which let them forage for thorny plants other animals can't eat.</li>

                    <li>Cicadas can survive a huge fall as babies, or nymphs. They are about the size of a grain of rice when they drop from a tree branch to the ground and start digging </li>
                    <li>They’re true bugs (from the order Hemiptera). So you can call them a bug and be scientifically accurate. </li>
                    <li>Most have red-orange eyes. But occasionally cicadas have blue, white or grayish eyes. Keep on the lookout.</li>

                    <li> Pigeons are highly sociable animals. They will often be seen in flocks of 20-30 birds. </li>
                    <li> Pigeons have excellent hearing abilities. They can detect sounds at far lower frequencies than humans are able to, and can thus hear distant storms and volcanoes. </li>
                    <li> Pigeons can fly at altitudes up to and beyond 6000 feet, and at an average speed of 77.6 mph. The fastest recorded speed is 92.5 mph.</li>

                        <li> The teddy was named after President Theodore Roosevelt, after he refused to shoot a bear during a 1902 hunting trip. </li>
                        <li> Inspired by a cartoon featuring the event, shopkeeper Morris Michtom and his wife Rose made a stuffed bear with a sign 'Teddy's bear' and left it in their shop window. </li>
